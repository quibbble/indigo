## Objective 🎯
Place tiles to create tangled paths that move gems to your advantage.

## Components 🧱
- A tiled hexagonal game board
- 7 Treasure Tiles
- 54 Route Tiles
- 24 Tokens, 6 🔴 6 🟢 6 ⚪ 6 🟣
- 24 Gems, 12 🟨 10 🟩 2 🟦

## Setting Up 🏗️
1. Put the game board in the middle of the table.
2. Place the 7 Treasure Tiles on the treasure spaces on the board. One in the middle and one in each corner. 
3. Place **5** 🟩 and **1** 🟦 on the middle Treasure Tile. Place **1** 🟨 on each of the other Treasure Tiles. 
4. There are 6 Gateways that represent each side of the hexagonal board. Distribute player tokens evenly across Gateways.
   - 2 players: | 🔴🔴 | 🟢🟢 | 🔴🔴 | 🟢🟢 | 🔴🔴 | 🟢🟢 |
   - 3 players: | 🔴🔴 | 🔴🟢 | ⚪⚪ | ⚪🔴 | 🟢🟢 | 🟢⚪ |
   - 4 players: | 🔴🟢 | 🟢⚪ | 🔴🟣 | 🟣🟢 | ⚪🔴 | ⚪🟣 |
5. Off to the side, stack up the Route Tiles face down.
6. Each player draws a Route Tiles from the stack and the youngest player goes first.
7. Play continues clockwise around the board.

## How to Play 🚀
What to do on your turn:

1. **Play your Route Tile:** Place your Route Tile on any open space on the board. Note that you may not place a Route Tile in such a way that the tile blocks two Gateway exit points with a curved path.

2. **Move the Gem(s):** After placing your Route Tile, move any adjacent gems along the connecting path. If a gem runs off the board and into a Gateway then the Gateway owner recieves the gem. If more than one player owns the Gateway then the other player also receives a gem of the same color from the reserve. If a gem collides with another gem then remove both gems from the game. 

3. **Take a Route Tile:** Pick up a Route Tile from the top of the stack. 

## How to Win 🏆
Keep playing until all tiles have been placed. Count up the final scores with each gem being worth the folllowing:

🟨 Amber - **1** &nbsp; 🟩 Emerald - **2** &nbsp; 🟦 Sapphire - **3**

That player with the highest score wins!

## Extra Rules 🤨
- Gems must follow the path of the Route Tile. They may not make any turns nor move backwards along the Route Tile.
- You may end the game early by deciding how many rounds to play before the game starts. Once the rounds have been played, tally up the final scores. 

## Variations 📍

- **Classic**: Standard Indigo.
- **Large Hands**: Each player has 2 Route Tiles in their hand instead of 1.
